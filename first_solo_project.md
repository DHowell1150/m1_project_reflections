### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. I used Mentors and Rocks a lot.  Probably too much.  I got confused between the different code each was helping me with. But it is always a helpful tool for me to watch how it's done in order to deconstruct and then reconstruct (either in my head or literally starting a new project) the things we've gone over. 

2. I was able to begin to use pry.  Still not well or proficient, but I can see how once I can utilize it more for what it is, it will be very helpful. I am confused on when you put it in rspec opposed to the Class file. 

3. I don't know that RSpec was a tool for me as much as it was another thing to figure out.  I'm hoping to understand all this more because I want to write and can utilize Rspec properly in order to test my code.

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:

This LinkedList project assigns data to nodes which when appended to the LinkedList and ran through the terminal, the collection creates a sound that mimics a beat box.  

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. How do you approach solving something when you donâ€™t have all the information?**
1. In this project in particular, I went back to utilize the past code from flash cards.  It was a helpful starting place to use as a framework to connect dots on both RSpec and the Class file.  

2. As I mentioned in the section about tools, I utilized mentors a lot. Videos that cohorts shared were quite helpful and I'd like to get better versed at looking those up myself.  One hold-up I'm recognizing is that if I don't see my exact code I'm looking for in the resources I find, I think it won't help.  I'm learning to really look at the logic of things even if the syntax isn't exactly what I need at the moment.  Unfortunately I learned this from some of the warmups and exercises more that I did in the project.  


**2. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?**<br />
I do take breaks.  Honestly I haven't found a most effective strategy to get through as much as I've gotten away from the blocks.  A lot of this might be mental and perhaps I just need to believe I can solve the problem so I dig in to get through it instead of taking a break to get away from it.  When I do the latter I come back just as stuck (or worse) than before. 

**3. Tell us about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle, how did you get out of it?**<br />
I hate to admit that I didn't do well here.  The append method really stumped me.  I asked for help several times from several people and watching them did not help very much as I didn't really ever understand it fully.  The terms are familiar, but the detailed understanding is not there.  

**4. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**<br />
While I struggled a lot with TDD, It is helpful once it's set up to be able to test the code.  Once Spec is built out you can focus on the code.
